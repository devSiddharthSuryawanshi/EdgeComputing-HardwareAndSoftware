# ECHS — Edge Computing Hardware & Software

ECHS is a practical lab-style repository focused on deploying real AI workloads on edge devices — starting with **NVIDIA Jetson Nano**.

All projects are tested on real hardware.

## Project Index

| Code | Project Title | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **TA-01** | Face Detection using Haar Cascade | Baseline OpenCV face detection on Jetson Nano (CPU / classical CV) |
| **TA-02** | Person Detection using Roboflow | Deep learning detection model exported from Roboflow and deployed on Jetson Nano |
| **End Sem** | Metal Surface Defect Detection | Industrial CV use-case for defect identification at the edge |

## Goal

Create small, reproducible, deployable edge-ML systems — not just notebooks.
